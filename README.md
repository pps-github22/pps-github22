### Hi there!! ðŸ‘‹

I am Priti and, I worked as a Full-Stack Data Engineer having hands-on experience in SQL, Snowflake, Python, and Data Visualization using Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Also, I have worked on tools like Tableau, DBT, Alteryx, and Matillion.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced Python Concepts, which will be used in Workflow Optimization in Alteryx.
